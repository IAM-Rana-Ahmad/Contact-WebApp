**Overview:**
In this project, I have developed a dynamic web application using ReactJS that allows users to fetch and manage user data from an API. The application consists of multiple features, including fetching data from an API, navigating to detail pages, real-time search functionality, and state management using Redux Toolkit.

**Features:**

1. **Fetching Data from an API:**
   - The application fetches user data from a remote API using Axios. The API provides a list of user details, including first name, last name, age, and email.

2. **Displaying User Data:**
   - The home page of the application displays the fetched user data in a table format. Each row represents a user, and the columns show user details such as first name, last name, age, and email.

3. **Navigation:**
   - Users can click on a "Detail" button associated with each user to open a new page displaying the specific user's detailed information.

4. **User Detail Page:**
   - The user detail page presents in-depth information about the selected user. It offers a comprehensive view of the user's data, such as their name, age, email, and other relevant information.

5. **Real-time Search Functionality:**
   - The application features a real-time search functionality. Users can enter a search query into the search bar, and the displayed user data immediately updates based on the search term. This feature allows users to find specific users quickly.

6. **State Management with Redux Toolkit:**
   - Redux Toolkit is used for state management. The application utilizes Redux actions and reducers to handle user interactions. It stores user data, manages the selected user for the detail view, and filters user data in response to search queries.

**Technologies Used:**
- ReactJS: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Axios: A library for making HTTP requests to fetch data from an external API.
- Redux Toolkit: A state management library for managing the application's state.
- React Router: A library for handling navigation between different pages in the application.

**Conclusion:**
This ReactJS user data management application demonstrates the use of various technologies and features for creating dynamic web applications. Users can easily navigate through the user data, access detailed information, and quickly search for specific users with the real-time search functionality. This project showcases a practical application of ReactJS and Redux Toolkit for state management.
